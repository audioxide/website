# audioxide.com

The code for the Audioxide website, built with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev) courtesy of [@sveltejs](https://github.com/sveltejs).

For local development: 

- Download
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

The [data](https://github.com/audioxide/data) repository needs to be running locally at the same time so the website has data to go fetch.
